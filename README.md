Bank-Account-Simulation
Simulate basic bank operations 

This is a simple Java program that simulates a bank account. It allows the user to:

Create an account with an initial balance

Deposit money

Withdraw money (if sufficient balance is available)

View current balance

View transaction history

The program uses a class called Account to manage the account holder's details, balance, and transaction history. The main menu runs in a loop and takes input from the user to perform banking operations.

It runs in the terminal and uses basic Java concepts like classes, methods, ArrayList, and Scanner for input.
